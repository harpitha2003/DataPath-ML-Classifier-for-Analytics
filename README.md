# DataPath-ML-Classifier-for-Analytics
A machine learning project using Random Forest to classify data and generate predictions. Includes a trained model and performance evaluation metrics.

# ML-Driven Data Classifier: Random Forest Project
## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a Random Forest Classifier to predict labels from a dataset. It includes:
- A trained Random Forest model (`trained_model.pkl`).
- A Jupyter Notebook (`ML_Data_Classifier.ipynb`) for training and evaluation.
- Performance metrics: Accuracy and classification report.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
- Model evaluation with detailed metrics.
